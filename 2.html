  <h2>13 VIRTUES</h2>
  <p>
    <p><strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong></p><img src="13 VIRTUES.jpg" width="50%">
    <br><br><strong>1. Temperance :</strong> Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>2. Silence :</strong> Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>3. Order :</strong> Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>4. Resolution :</strong> Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>5. Frugality :</strong> Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; that is, waste nothing.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>6. Industry :</strong> Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>7. Sincerity :</strong> Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; speak accordingly.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>8. Justice :</strong> Wrong none by doing injuries; or omitting the benefits that are your duty.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>9. Moderation :</strong> Avoid extremes; forebear resenting injuries so much as you think deserve.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>10. Cleanliness :</strong> Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>11. Tranquility :</strong> Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>12. Chastity :</strong> Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.<br></br>

    <br><br><strong>13. Humility :</strong> Imitate Jesus and Socrates.<br></br>
